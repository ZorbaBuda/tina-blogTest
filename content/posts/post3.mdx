# Introduction

Parsing and display of math equations is included in this blog template. Parsing of math is enabled by `remark-math` and `rehype-katex`.
KaTeX and its associated font is included in  so feel free to use it on any page.


For the full list of supported TeX functions, check out the [KaTeX documentation](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html)

Inline math symbols can be included by enclosing the term between the `$` symbol.

Math code blocks are denoted by 

If you intend to use the `$` sign instead of math, you can escape it (`\$`), or specify the HTML entity (`&dollar;`) [^2]

Inline or manually enumerated footnotes are also supported. Click on the links above to see them in action.



# Deriving the OLS Estimator

Using matrix notation, lenote the number of observations adenote the number of regressors.

The vector of outcom



The matrix of regressos a $n \times x (or each row is a


The vector of error ts also a $n \times 

At times it might be easier to use vector notation. For consistency, I will use the bold small x to denote a vector and capital letters to denote a matrix. Single observations are denoted by the subscript.
